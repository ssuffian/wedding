              We are very privileged to have everything we need & more for our
              future together. We also recognize that many guests are taking on
              considerable expense and time to travel to our wedding. Thank you
              so much for your presence and generosity! Our biggest wish for our wedding is for our family
              and friends to connect and create a sense of community together. Your
              openess to meeting strangers and active participation will be the most meaningful contributions.

              For those interested in giving in other ways, we would be honored
              if our wedding could play a small role in supporting the important
              work of community organizations and social justice movements. If
