              We are very privileged to have everything we need & more for our
              future together. We also recognize that many guests are taking on
              considerable expense and time to travel to our wedding. Thank you
              so much for your presence and generosity!

              For those interested in giving in other ways, we would be honored
              if our wedding could play a small role in supporting the important
              work of community organizations and social justice movements. If
              you would like to make a donation in honor of our wedding, here
              are some causes that are meaningful to us:
