            <p>
              We are still figuring out exact timings, but the wedding will
              start mid-afternoon. The celebration will go like this:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Becky and Steve will host separate, joyful gatherings open to
                all guests, modeled on traditional Jewish tisches
              </li>
              <li>
                Both gatherings will come together, and we will sign our ketubah
                (Jewish marriage contract)
              </li>
              <li>
                We will transition to a meaningful wedding ceremony under a
                chuppah
              </li>
              <li>
                Party time! Weâ€™ll have dinner, dancing, and bonfires into the
                night
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We will update this page with more details on the schedule. If you
              want to learn more about our approach to our Jewish wedding, an
              overview of wedding rituals and traditions, and other Jewish
              practices throughout the weekend, please see our Jewish Wedding
              page.

            <p>
              On the morning of Memorial Day, we will host a brunch at the camp.
              We are figuring out the exact timing and will update this page,
              but the timing will neither be very early nor very late.
