              There are two options for where to stay during the wedding
              weekend:
            </p>
            <h2>Option 1: Stay at Camp Laurelwood</h2>
            <p>
              Becky and Steve will happily be staying at camp the entire
              weekend. You’re all invited to join, but staying in rustic cabins
              may not be everyone’s cup of tea.
            </p>
            <p>Cabin Details:</p>
            <v-container>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>COST:</b> The cost to stay in a cabin is $50 per person per
                  night. Kids under 5 years old stay for free!
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>BEDS:</b> Each cabin has about a dozen wooden bunk beds,
                  plus some single-beds. All beds have twin-size mattresses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>BEDDING:</b> Cabins do not include pillows, sheets,
                  sleeping bags, blankets, or towels. The RSVP form asks if you plan to
                  bring any of these items or if you’d like to request them. For
                  example, guests traveling by airplane may not be able to pack
                  all these items and can request to receive what they cannot
                  bring.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>PEOPLE:</b> We expect approximately 4-8 people per cabin,
                  depending on how many people choose to stay in cabins.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>FEATURES:</b> Each cabin has electricity, cubby storage,
                  closets, bathroom stalls, and sinks. Cabins do not have air
                  conditioning or heating.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>SHOWERS:</b> Showers are located in separate, newly
                  renovated shower buildings located a short walk from each
                  cabin.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>PARKING:</b> Overnight guests can drive directly up to
                  cabins and remain parked there.
                </li>
              </ul>

            <h4>More than 15 min drive from camp:</h4>
            <p>
              The nearby towns of Branford, Westbrook, Old Saybrook, and Essex
              have a number of hotels, resorts, motels, and B&Bs.
            </p>
            <p>
              New Haven is a 30 min drive from camp and has a number of options.
              (Yale’s graduation will not be on our wedding weekend, which helps
              with room availability).
            </p>
            <p>
              There are some local options on
              <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> and
