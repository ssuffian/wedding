                  What will be the COVID-19 mitigation measures during the
                  wedding weekend?
                </v-expansion-panel-header>
                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  <p>
                    Your health and well-being during our wedding weekend is our
                    highest concern. We understand that COVID-19 mitigation
                    measures are a personal and emotional topic for many people.
                    We also recognize that pandemic conditions, CDC guidelines,
                    and state regulations will likely change between now and
                    then. We don’t know what May 2022 will bring, but we will
                    monitor updates closely and keep this website updated.
                  </p>

                  <p>For now, there are a few things we know definitively:</p>

                  <v-container
                    ><ul>
                      <li>
                        Any guest age 12+ must be fully vaccinated to attend our
                        wedding weekend. This means that, at least 2 weeks
                        before the wedding, guests over the age of 12 must have
                        received 1 dose of a single-dose vaccine or 2 doses of a
                        two-dose vaccine. We do not make this decision lightly, but we feel a responsibility to protect our guests, vendors, and camp
                        employees from unnecessary risk, especially individuals with suppressed immune systems due to medical conditions and children who are unable to be vaccinated at this time.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The RSVP form asks for all guests’ vaccination status.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        This will be a large gathering. We are expecting
                        hundreds of guests.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Attending a big wedding during a pandemic can be a
                        difficult and emotional decision for many guests. We
                        absolutely understand (and we don't take it personally) if
                        guests cannot attend.
                      </li>

                  >

                  As we get closer to the wedding, we will confirm other
                  COVID-19 measures and update them on this website. Measures
                  may include:
                  <v-container
                    ><ul>
                      <li>
                        If younger ages are approved for vaccination, we may
                        require guests under age 12 to be fully vaccinated.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        We may require guests to show proof of vaccination
                        and/or boosters.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        We may require guests to be tested before the
                        wedding and/or upon entry.
                      </li>
                      <li>We may hold all wedding events outdoors.</li>
                      <li>
                        If we hold indoor events, we may require guests
                        to wear a mask.
                      </li>

                  Will there be a virtual ceremony for people who cannot attend
                  in-person?
                </v-expansion-panel-header>
                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  No, we will not live-stream our wedding ceremony. However, we
                  will take some video, which can be shared with guests after
                  the wedding.

                  As a Jewish camp, Camp Laurelwood ensures that all food
                  prepared on site is kosher. For guests staying in cabins, all
                  your meals and snacks will be provided at camp (from Saturday
                  lunch to Monday breakfast). For guests staying outside camp,
                  the RSVP form asks which meals you plan to attend at camp. For
                  more details about mealtimes, please visit the Schedule page.

                  What are accessibility supports at the camp?
                </v-expansion-panel-header>
                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  Camp Laurelwood sits on 140 acres, and we understand some
                  guests will need support to reach events throughout the camp.
                  We will rent several golf carts the entire weekend, and we
                  will do our best to arrange golf cart rides for guests who
                  need support to get around camp. The RSVP form asks for
                  guests’ accessibility needs, including golf carts.

                  If I'm not staying at camp, can I still participate in camp
                  activities and meals?
                </v-expansion-panel-header>
                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  Yes! For any guests not staying overnight in cabins, you are
                  welcome to spend as much time at camp as you wish. The RSVP
                  form asks which meals you plan to attend at camp.

                  Is there parking at camp?
                </v-expansion-panel-header>
                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  Yes, the camp has free parking. Overnight guests can drive
                  directly up to cabins and remain parked there. Daytime guests
                  should park in the main parking lot at the entrance of camp
                  (or on the nearby field, if the lot is full).

                  What’s the dress code?
                </v-expansion-panel-header>
                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  The dress code most of the weekend will be casual, with the
                  exception of the wedding itself. The wedding dress code is on
                  a spectrum, ranging from nice jeans & a nice shirt all the way
                  to a suit. Yes, nice jeans are totally fine at the wedding!
                  Blazers and ties are optional. Sundresses, cocktail dresses,
                  and rompers are all great, but we don’t recommend super long
                  dresses, in case the bottom gets dirty. Please wear whatever
                  makes you feel comfortable and special. You’re also welcome to
                  look funky and weird! For example, funny hats, colorful
                  clothing, or other surprises. Make sure to wear practical
                  shoes, since there will be lots of grass, gravel, and wooded
                  trails. While packing, look up the weather in Madison, CT to
                  better prepare for what to wear. Bring layers, in case it gets
                  hot during the day, cold at night, or rains.

                  I’m staying in a cabin. What should I pack?

                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  Here’s a suggested packing list:
                  <v-container
                    ><ul>
                      <li>Twin bed sheets and a blanket, or a sleeping bag</li>
                      <li>Pillow</li>
                      <li>Towel and/or robe for showering</li>
                      <li>Flip flops or shower shoes</li>
                      <li>Swimsuit and towel for the lake</li>
                      <li>Toiletries</li>
                      <li>Flashlight or headlamp</li>
                      <li>Bug spray</li>
                      <li>Sunscreen</li>
                      <li>Rain gear or light jacket, depending on forecast</li>
                      <li>Reusable water bottle</li>
                      <li>
                        You may want to bring lawn chairs, a fan, and musical
                        instruments.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </v-container>
                  Need bedding or towels? The RSVP form asks if you plan to
                  bring bedding and/or towels, or if you will need any of these
                  items. For example, guests traveling by airplane may not be
                  able to pack bedding or towels and can request to receive what
                  they cannot bring.

                  Is there wifi at camp?
                </v-expansion-panel-header>
                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  Only a few facilities at camp offer wifi, and the cabins do
                  not have wifi. Plan for limited service, but we can connect in
                  person! Luckily, our friends and family are pretty awesome.

                  <p>
                    To best manage our numbers, costs, catering, and COVID-19
                    mitigation measures, your invitation specifically states who
                    is invited.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regarding kids, the entire weekend will be family-friendly,
                    and we’re hoping to book babysitters for parts of the
                    weekend (updates to come as we get closer to the wedding).

                  Do I need to pay for individual camp activities?
                </v-expansion-panel-header>
                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  Nope! All camp activities are free for all guests.

                  Can I stay in my own tent at the camp?
                </v-expansion-panel-header>
                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  Yes, but the camp does not prefer this, and it will still cost
                  you $50 per person per night (the same cost as a cabin).
                  Please consider staying in a cabin instead. But if you’re
                  super interested in camping, please contact us.

                <v-expansion-panel-content>
                  Unfortunately, the camp does not allow pets.

                  No, we are not reserving room blocks. If you’d like to stay in
                  a local hotel or B&B, please book wherever you’d like. Our
                  Where to Stay page lists some local options.

                  We are not planning to have a shuttle to/from the camp.
                  Regarding driving conditions at night, the roads to the camp
                  are paved, wide, and in a residential area.

                  Nope! After they’re married, they’ll still be Becky Mer and
                  Stephen Suffian. But if any guests would like to take this as
                  an opportunity to change their last name, we’d be honored.
